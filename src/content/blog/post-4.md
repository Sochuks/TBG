A good morning routine sets the tone for the rest of your day. Here's how to create one:

1. **Wake Up Early**: Give yourself enough time to ease into the day.
2. **Hydrate**: Drink a glass of water to kickstart your metabolism.
3. **Exercise**: Even a short workout can boost your energy levels.
4. **Plan Your Day**: Write down your top priorities for the day.
5. **Practice Mindfulness**: Spend a few minutes meditating or journaling.
